                                           // Practice exercise 1.1
// Working with the console:
// 1. Open the browser console, type 4 + 10, and press Enter. What do you see as
// the response?


// Answer: 14
// When I open the browser console and type 4 + 10 and then press Enter, I see the response as 14, which is the result of the addition operation.


// 2. Use the console.log() syntax, placing a value within the rounded brackets.
// Try entering your name with quotes around it (this is to indicate the fact that
// it's a text stringâ€”we'll get to this in the next chapter)

// Answer: When I run this command in the console, it will display my name enclosed in quotes, indicating that it's a text string.
console.log("UroojNaz");



                                            //Practice exercise 1.3
// Linking to a JS JavaScript file:
// 1. Create a separate file called app with the extension .js.
// 2. Within the .js file, add some JavaScript code.

// Answer:
console.log("Hello from app.js!");
document.write("Hello from app.js!")



                                            // Practice exercise 1.4
// Adding comments:
// 1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value. 
// Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line: 
// let a = 10;
// 2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of 
// 10.

// Answer:
let a = 10;   // Set the value of 'a' to 10


// 3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this will do  

// Answer:
console.log(a); // Print the value of 'a' to the console



// 4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real 
// production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the 
// purpose of the file


/* Answer:
   This JavaScript file is for practice exercises.
   It demonstrates the use of variables, comments, and console.log() statements.
   Feel free to experiment with the code and comments!
